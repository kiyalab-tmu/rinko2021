# Chapter 1: Basics
### The following 5 questions are just to warm you up in programmin with Python.

### Q.1: FizzBuzz
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

### Q.2: Quick Sort
Implement a quick sort (divide-and-conquer) algorithm. You can read about it
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort#:~:text=Quicksort%20is%20a%20divide%2Dand,sometimes%20called%20partition%2Dexchange%20sort.).

Sample Input: [9, 8, 7, 5, 6, 3, 1, 2, 4]

Sample Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

### Q.3: Missing Element
You are given two arrays. One is a shuffled version of another one, but missing
one element. Write a program to find a missing element.

Sample Input: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 5, 8], [6, 8, 7, 4, 5, 2, 3]

Sample Output: 5

### Q.4: Pair Sum
You are given an array. Write a program to output all possible pairs that sum to
a specific value **k**.

Sample Input: [1, 3, 2, 2], **k** = 4

Sample Output: (1, 3) (2, 2)

### Q.5: Multiplication Table
Write a program that outputs a multiplication table like the following picture.

### The following 5 questions are for NumPy. If you have used MATLAB, you will be just fine.
The question are extracted from [numpy-100](https://github.com/rougier/numpy-100/blob/master/100_Numpy_exercises.ipynb) and you can practise more if you have time.

### Q.6: Create a checkerboard 8x8 matrix using the tile function.

### Q.7: Normalize a 5x5 random matrix.

### Q.8: Multiply a 5x3 matrix by a 3x2 matrix (real matrix product)

### Q.9: Given a 1D array, negate all elements which are between 3 and 8, in place.

### Q.10: Consider two random array A and B, check if they are equal.
